# Serialization

- In serialization, objects and data structures residing in memory are transformed to stream of bits, so that they can be written to disk (for example) or sent over network
- Basically, serialize function transforms data structure to string, which can be then sent to the recipient
- Recipient can then deserialize the string back to data structure
- Examples of serialization formats
	- JSON
	- YAML
	- XML

## Libraries

### Python

- pickle
	- saves data as byte stream
